## American Sign Language<br>

American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made by moving the hands combined with facial expressions and postures of the body. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are hearing impaired and is one of several communication options used by people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Normally, sign languages used in daily communication are hand gesture version of phases and even sentences. Yet, there are situations when letters themselves are needed to emphasize or just to spell words. For instance, knowing how to spell words is fundermental for children who are congenitally deaf, and knowing how to spell them in hand gestures is the best way to remember words. Thus out of necessity, comes American Sign Language Alphabets.<br>

Just like English, Each hand gesture in American Sigh Language Alphabets correspond with each one in English alphabets. twenty-six hand gestures differ in shape. As is shown in figure, there are gestures like fist and half fist, sure it is easy for people who master ASL to recognize immediately when seeing them. However, for people who are just starting to learn or have no idea what it is at all, it will be tremendously difficult to understand. In fact, this project is originated from a rising phenomenon that an increasing number of American parents have trouble in teaching their  hearing impaired children English. This project is meant to help these people, which is a large number of for sure, to understand, and even start to learn and practice ASL alphabets. It is believed that the initiation of this project is mutually beneficial for both sides.<br>

So what we accutrally do in this project is a recognition of ASL alphabets and find the corrresponded English alphabet. By recognizing the gestures made by human, we can traslate them into English which is more familiar to us in **real time**. Thus, once applied in real life, people who use it can understand those geatures' meaning immediately and communicate without delay and misunderstading.<br>
